# JSON_codes

This is my JSON repo.

i want to learn more of JSON because it is widely used in RESTful services.

JSON also integrates very nicely with JavaScript since JSON is just a subset of JavaScript, which means anything you write in a JSON is a valid JavaScript.

Almost every single major language has some form of library or built-in functionality to parse JSON strings into objects or classes in that language.

This makes working with JSON data extremely easy inside of a programming language.
